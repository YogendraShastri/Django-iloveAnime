    'About_us_desc': """Im Yogi, just another working professional navigating the intricate world of coding and development. Like many of you, I embarked on this journey to enhance my skills and delve into the fascinating realm of programming. In the pursuit of knowledge, I found a passion for Python, a language that speaks to the heart of simplicity and versatility.

To share this enthusiasm and facilitate our collective growth, I created the Instagram page "become_pythondevloper" (yes it's developer, not devloper, the quirky spelling was the only available option on Instagram at the time!). This platform is more than just a collection of code snippets; it's a community where learners like us can connect, exchange ideas, and navigate the sometimes challenging path of becoming Python developers.""",
    'Front_page_content': """
Learning can be much fun once you start applying it. This website is just here because i wanted to apply my learning and while doing so i thought i should add my learnigs here so that i can take references later and the community people can also learn. anyone can find topics which can help them to grow. it is absolutly free and will always be free.
